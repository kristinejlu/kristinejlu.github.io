            <strong>Kristine</strong> is a PhD Candidate in Learning Sciences at Northwestern University and a graduate
            researcher in the interdisciplinary Delta Lab. Her research interests are at the intersection of learning
            and information environments, particularly data, information, and systems design for civic decision-making.
            Prior to Northwestern, Kristine conducted journalism research at the Pew Research Center in Washington,
            D.C., where she worked on a variety of quantitative social science projects related to civic engagement and
            news attitudes and consumption. Her research experience also includes work in computational linguistics,
            digital humanities, educational technology, and information literacy. She graduated cum laude with a
            Bachelor of Arts in English & Comparative Literature from Columbia University.

            neutrality by 2050, we need active and engaged citizens. Some of
            these citizens, like social entrepreneurs, will dedicate their
            entire careers to advancing these goals. I study and design
            technologies to increase civic participation through activism and
            deliberation and to help social entrepreneurs navigate their careers
            through mentorship. <br /><br />
